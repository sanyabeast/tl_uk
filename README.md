# Torchlight Ukrainian Localization Project

Welcome to the Torchlight Ukrainian Localization Project. This is a community-driven initiative to translate Torchlight, the popular action RPG developed by Runic Games, into Ukrainian. Our goal is to make this exciting game more accessible to Ukrainian-speaking players.

## Author and Maintainer
This project is initiated and maintained by [@sanyabeast](https://github.com/sanyabeast) (Kyiv, Ukraine, 2023).

## Installation
To install the Ukrainian localization for Torchlight, follow these steps:

1. Download the `TRANSLATION.DAT.adm` file from the `output/` directory in this repository.

2. Locate your Torchlight game folder. This will be different depending on your platform and whether you're using Steam:
    - Windows (Steam): `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Torchlight`
    - Mac (Steam): `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Torchlight`
    - Linux (Steam): `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Torchlight`

3. Inside the Torchlight game folder, find the `translations/` directory.

4. Move the `TRANSLATION.DAT.adm` file that you downloaded into the `translations/` directory.

5. Start the game. You should now be able to select Ukrainian as a language in the game's settings.
